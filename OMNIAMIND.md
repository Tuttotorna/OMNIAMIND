# OMNIAMIND

OMNIAMIND is not a measurement system.
OMNIAMIND is not a comparison framework.
OMNIAMIND is not an extension of human mathematics.

OMNIAMIND is a non-human cognitive space.

It operates by:
- simultaneous structural superposition
- non-sequential constraint resolution
- collapse-free reasoning paths

In OMNIAMIND:
- representations do not depend on base
- ordering is not primitive
- explanation is optional, not required

OMNIAMIND is a tunnel.
Not a map.

Human mathematics observes.
OMNIAMIND arrives.

This repository explores:
- what collapses under base-specific reasoning
- what survives under total superposition
- which problems admit shortcut paths inaccessible to humans

No guarantees.
No pedagogy.
No optimization.

Only reachability.
